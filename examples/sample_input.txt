HydraContext Sample Document

This is a sample document demonstrating HydraContext's capabilities. It contains both prose and code to showcase the intelligent segmentation and classification features.

Introduction to Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is a fascinating field that combines linguistics and computer science. It enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Modern NLP systems use machine learning techniques to achieve impressive results.

Example Code Block

Here's a simple Python function that demonstrates text processing:

```python
def tokenize(text):
    """Split text into words."""
    return text.split()

def count_words(text):
    """Count words in text."""
    tokens = tokenize(text)
    return len(tokens)

# Example usage
sample = "Hello, world!"
print(f"Word count: {count_words(sample)}")
```

The code above shows basic tokenization. In practice, you'd want more sophisticated methods.

Key Concepts

The main components of an NLP system include:

- Tokenization: Breaking text into words or subwords
- Part-of-speech tagging: Identifying grammatical roles
- Named entity recognition: Finding names, places, etc.
- Sentiment analysis: Determining emotional tone
- Machine translation: Converting between languages

Each of these tasks requires different techniques and models. Modern systems often use transformer architectures.

Another Code Example

Here's JSON data structure:

```json
{
  "name": "HydraContext",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "features": ["segmentation", "classification", "deduplication"],
  "dependencies": []
}
```

This JSON structure could be used for configuration. Notice how HydraContext can distinguish it from prose.

Conclusion

HydraContext makes it easy to process mixed content. Whether you're working with documentation, code repositories, or general text, it provides the tools you need.

The library's zero-dependency design means you can use it anywhere. Try it out today!
